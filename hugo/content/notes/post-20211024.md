Almost a year ago we decided to give [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) an opportunity for a new product we were cooking.

The product involves generating NRT indicators over several streams of data coming from Kafka. Volume is high in general but it has to cope with peak retail sales (BF, sales season, etc).

Usually we'd turn to [KStreams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) for this kind of processing. To reduce latency, in this product we decided to serve the indicators directly to consumers over websockets. The pipeline design made us think of Vert.x.

At first working with Vert.x seems a bit odd but once you get over initial surprise (things like JsonObject, etc...) it's a delight to work with it. 

**Performance both in development (productivity) and execution time is excellent**.

After almost a year in production without a hiccup I just can say: *Vert.x, It's been a pleasure to meet you!*.

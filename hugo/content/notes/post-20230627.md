I've done my share of streaming. Most of it involved Kafka (as a source, as a sink or both). But not only (processing MySQL changelog directly). 

Usually for me stream processing means using Kafka as a datasource. The result goes back to Kafka or something else.

Kafka provides several APIs (or one API with several layers of abstraction) to consume data from it. IMHO best experience comes from using those APIs in truly reactive frameworks (i.e. Vertx).

~~Different stream processing frameworks have been built on top of it.~~ Different stream processing frameworks can use Kafka as a datasource. Naming them doesn't make sense: something new comes up every day. Take into account that I use the term _stream processing framework_ quite liberally. I consider [Materialize](https://materialize.com/) one of them. 

Kafka stack includes its own _general purpose stream processing framework_: **Kafka Streams**. Main incumbent considered **Apache Flink**.

Some months ago Confluent [acquired](https://www.confluent.io/press-release/confluent-plans-immerok-acquisition-to-accelerate-cloud-native-apache-flink/) Immerok, one of the solutions in the _"cloud-native, fully managed Flink service"_ space. Confluent plans to offer Flink as another stream processing solution into its cloud offering using Immerok technology and expertise. Right now KSQL is the alternative (as a managed solution using Confluent cloud).

That decision sparked again byzantine discussions comparing Kafka Streams and Flink. I'm not interested in that discussion.

Comparatives (between Kafka Streams and Apache Flink) usually stay on the surface (Flink is better because same topology can do batch processing and can do stream processing). I'll try **to capture here main differences between them as a helpful resource to anyone using one of them and considering using the other one**.

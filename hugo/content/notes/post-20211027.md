Hand-coding complex domain entities (with many nested levels) for unit testing is a major pain point.

Taking Avro into consideration make the problem worse (polymorphic union types).

Discovering [RandomBeans](https://glytching.github.io/junit-extensions/randomBeans.html) extension it's been a relief. 

**Recommended!**.

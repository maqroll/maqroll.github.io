            <div class=body>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc">rc</a> was built from scratch for plan9 operating system.</p>
            	<p>Simple and powerful, I was very fond of it. Code is short enough to be manageable and good enough to learn from it.</p>
            	<p>At that time I used cygwin so <a href="https://github.com/maqroll/rcshell4cygwin">patched</a> the original code to work in cygwin. rc package available in cygwin was a <a href="https://github.com/rakitzis/rc">rewrite</a>.</p>
            	<p>I haven't used it for ages.</p>

      <description> BePP Most impactful project so far.
Between 2002 and 2003 I led a great team that designed a new architecture for home banking applications for a major global brand.
Three installations were made in Portugal. After successive mergers, the only one that survives is netbanco.
As of 2020/09/01 is alive and (seems to be) using the same platform.

      <description> Metropolis Around 2008 we designed a new core-banking architecture for a major bank in Spain codenamed &#34;Metropolis&#34;.
That technology later became CECA&#39;s reference architecture.
Still in use.

      <description> NRT sales funnel Imagine the look&amp;feel of funnel-graph-js but updated in near-realtime (less than 5 seconds lag) segmented by country, device type, etc...
You got it!
Besides: top N products in each step (visits, carts and orders) filterable for different criteria(country, section, etc..).
Sure you&#39;ll miss something like this next BF.

      <description> password() Instead of storing your passwords calculate them using a secure hash function conveniently.
oneshallpass.com reincarnated as a tampermonkey script available through a hotkey.

      <description> rc shell for cygwin rc was built from scratch for plan9 operating system.
Simple and powerful, I was very fond of it. Code is short enough to be manageable and good enough to learn from it.
At that time I used cygwin so patched the original code to work in cygwin. rc package available in cygwin was a rewrite.
I haven&#39;t used it for ages.

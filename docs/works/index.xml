      <description> BePP Most impactful project so far.
Between 2002 and 2003 I led a great team that designed a new architecture for home banking applications for a major global brand.
Three installations were made in Portugal. After successive mergers, the only one that survives is netbanco.
As of 2020/09/01 is alive and (seems to be) using the same platform.

      <description> Metropolis Around 2008 we designed a new core-banking architecture for a major bank in Spain codenamed &#34;Metropolis&#34;.
That technology later became CECA&#39;s reference architecture.
Still in use.

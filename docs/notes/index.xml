      <description>Almost a year ago we decided to give Eclipse Vert.x an opportunity for a new product we were cooking.
The product involves generating NRT indicators over several streams of data coming from Kafka. Volume is high in general but it has to cope with peak retail sales (BF, sales season, etc).
Usually we&amp;rsquo;d turn to KStreams for this kind of processing. To reduce latency, in this product we decided to serve the indicators directly to consumers over websockets.</description>

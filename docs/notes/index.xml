      <title>Hacking Kafka Connect</title>

      <description>Second time we face the same problem: process Avro messages with Kafka Connect honoring a schema already setup in Schema Registry.
It looks like the typical interview problem you&amp;rsquo;ll never find in real life. But you know, it&amp;rsquo;s sitting on the sofa.
The interest of this note (if any) is not providing an answer but thinking about why we solved it differently the second time.
 Kafka Connect is a generic framework for processing Kafka messages.</description>

      <description>Hand-coding complex domain entities (with many nested levels) for unit testing is a major pain point.
Taking Avro into consideration make the problem worse (polymorphic union types).
Discovering RandomBeans extension it&amp;rsquo;s been a relief.
Recommended!.</description>

      <description>Almost a year ago we decided to give Eclipse Vert.x an opportunity for a new product we were cooking.
The product involves generating NRT indicators over several streams of data coming from Kafka. Volume is high in general but it has to cope with peak retail sales (BF, sales season, etc).
Usually we&amp;rsquo;d turn to KStreams for this kind of processing. To reduce latency, in this product we decided to serve the indicators directly to consumers over websockets.</description>
